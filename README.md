# Wavelets-Extension
A re-implementation of Wavelets package using Cypthon to improve the speed. 

All the functions are similar to the main Wavelets repository

## Building
* Clone the repo
* Run the setup to generate the shared object/ dll files
```
$ python setup_dev.py build_ext --inplace
```
* Just like other api call the functions

## API
* I only needed the Compressors and the 1D wavelet decomposition and reconstruction
* For other implementations you can use the main repo or help me port the code!
